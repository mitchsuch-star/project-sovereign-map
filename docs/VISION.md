## One-Line Pitch

A Napoleonic strategy game where you **talk to your generals** — and they talk back.

## Core Innovation: Disobedience as Negotiation

Players don't click armies. They type commands:

```
"Marshal Ney, attack Wellington"
"Davout, hold the line at Belgium"
"Grouchy, march to the sound of the guns"
```

Marshals have **personalities**. They can object, question, or disobey:

- **Ney (Aggressive):** Refuses to defend. Wants to charge.
- **Davout (Cautious):** Refuses suicidal attacks. Wants to fortify.
- **Grouchy (Literal):** Follows orders exactly — even when they're wrong.

When a marshal objects, the player chooses: **Trust** (accept their judgment), **Insist** (override them), or **Compromise**. This builds or destroys trust over time.

## Three Layers of Agency

```
Layer 1: ADVISORS (future)
  Talleyrand: "Sire, attacking Austria would provoke a coalition."
  → Gates what you CAN do (diplomacy, intel)

Layer 2: MARSHALS (implemented)
  Ney: "Attack? With pleasure!" / Davout: "Those odds are suicide."
  → Gates HOW your orders are executed

Layer 3: NATIONS (future)
  Prussia: *secretly negotiates with Austria*
  → The world reacts to your actions
```

## The Grouchy Moment

The game's signature dramatic beat: a marshal hears cannon fire from a nearby battle. What do they do?

- **Aggressive marshals** want to march to the guns
- **Cautious marshals** ask for orders
- **Literal marshals** (Grouchy) **continue their original orders** — even as history changes around them

This is not random punishment. It's personality-driven drama that the player can see coming and choose to prevent (or not).

## Target Audience

- Strategy gamers who love Paradox games (EU4, CK3, Victoria)
- History enthusiasts interested in Napoleonic era
- Players who want AI that feels like people, not calculators
- Anyone who's ever yelled "why won't my general just DO what I said"

## What This Game Is NOT

- Not a real-time strategy game
- Not a hex-grid tactical combat game
- Not a historical simulation (it's historically *inspired*)
- Not multiplayer (single-player campaign focus)

## Design Philosophy

1. **LLMs explain, react, color — they never cause.** Game mechanics are deterministic. AI adds personality and narrative.
2. **Building Blocks.** Player and enemy use the same actions, same executor, same rules.
3. **Personality over randomness.** Marshal behavior is predictable from their character. Drama comes from character clashes, not dice rolls.
4. **Every input gets a response.** No silent failures. The game always talks back.
