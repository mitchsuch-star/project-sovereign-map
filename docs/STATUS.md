## Phase 7 Core Sessions

### Feb 23 — Session 57: Combined Arms Detection

**43 new tests, 3394 total (3 skipped). Phase 7 Core begins.**

- **Combined arms detection:** Count distinct unit types (infantry/cavalry/artillery) among eligible same-nation marshals in a region. 2 types = +10% atk / +5% def. 3 types = +20% atk / +10% def. France is the only nation capable of 3/3 (structural player advantage).
- **Transient field pattern (D5):** Coordination bonuses set dynamically via `_calculate_coordination_context()`, read via `getattr(self, field, 0.0)`, cleared after combat. NOT in `__init__`, NOT serialized.
- **Single multiplier (A-C1):** `total_coordination_attack_bonus` / `total_coordination_defense_bonus` — one line each in `get_attack_modifier()` / `get_defense_modifier()`. All future coordination sources (per-ally, dedicated, adjacent) sum into this single field, then cap at +25% atk / +20% def.
- **Both sides calculated (A-C3):** `_calculate_coordination_context()` called for attacker AND defender independently before `resolve_battle()`.
- **Bombardment excluded (A-D6):** Coordination not wired into bombardment path.
- **Files modified:** `executor.py` (+`_count_unit_types`, `_get_combined_arms_bonus`, `_calculate_coordination_context`, `_clear_coordination_fields`, attack wiring), `marshal.py` (1 line each in atk/def modifiers), `combat.py` (combined arms tactical_prefix message), `battle_report.py` (snapshot captures CA + total coordination).
- **Files created:** `tests/test_combined_arms.py` (43 tests across 8 test classes).

## Phase 6.5 Sessions

### Feb 22 (Davout Counter-Punch Mastery + Special Abilities Evaluation)

**Davout's "Counter-Punch Mastery" ability wired. 22 new tests, 3351 total.**

- **Ability:** +20% attack on next attack after Davout is attacked (any combat outcome, any target). Boolean `counter_punch_ready` field — set when defender in combat (if survived), consumed on next `get_attack_modifier()` call, cleared at turn end if unused.
- **Files modified:** `marshal.py` (field + ability definition + modifier), `combat.py` (trigger + result flag), `battle_report.py` (snapshot label), `marshal_overview.py` (`_WIRED_ABILITY_MARSHALS` + unit specifics), `world_state.py` (turn-end clearing + game state summary), `executor.py` (broken state clearing).
- **6 wired abilities total:** Ney (+2 shock), Davout (+20% counter-punch), Drouot (15% fort degradation), Wellington (+5% defense), Blucher (+3k pursuit), Uxbridge (+5k pursuit).
- **Special Abilities Evaluation complete:** `docs/SPECIAL_ABILITIES_EVALUATION.md` — 3 Davout designs proposed, existing abilities reviewed (all balanced for Phase 7), UI surface audit (5 manual / 6 auto), 1805 roster planning principles and candidate lists documented.
- **ADDING_CONTENT.md expanded:** "Wiring a Special Ability" 16-step checklist, common mistakes table, file audit.

### Feb 22 (Phase 6.5 UI Audit)

**Code quality audit of all Phase 6.5 menu systems. 9 new tests, 1 pre-existing fix, 3354 total.**

- **Audit scope:** Pause Menu, Campaign Log, Morning Dispatch, Notification Bar, Top Bar, Strategic Ledger, Marshal Management. Checked int() wrapping, serialization, input blocking, CanvasLayer ordering, edge cases, endpoints, test coverage, consistency.
- **Fixes (bugs):** `/campaign_log` endpoint missing `"success"` key + game state guard. `GET /notifications` missing game state guard. `test_marshal_overview.py::test_endpoint_no_game_returns_error` called `game_state.clear()` without restore, poisoning subsequent tests (caused pre-existing `test_recklessness_2_blocks_defensive_stance` failure).
- **Fixes (comments):** `campaign_log.gd` layer comment corrected (102 -> 50).
- **New tests:** 5 endpoint tests for `/campaign_log`, 4 endpoint tests for `/notifications`.
- **Tech debt documented:** `_format_number()` duplication (3 files), color palette duplication (3+ files), marshal scroll hardcoded 320px/card. All tagged for Map Renderer refactor. Added to ROADMAP.md Tech Debt table.
- **Hooks fix:** `.claude/settings.local.json` PostToolUse/PreToolUse hooks had bash `$(...)` quoting bug with nested Python parentheses — split into variable assignments.

### Feb 21 (Marshal Management UI)

**Card-based read-only marshal management screen. 68 new tests, 3320 total.**

- `backend/game_logic/marshal_overview.py` — `build_marshal_overview(world)` returns per-marshal data cards (identity, ability, combat stats, trust/standing, status, unit specifics, relationships). All values int()-wrapped.
- `backend/models/marshal.py` — `biography` field added to `__init__`, `to_dict()`, `from_dict()`. Historical blurbs set for all 9 marshals (Berthier's voice).
- `marshal_management.gd/tscn` — CanvasLayer 50, vertical scrollable card list, BBCode rendering, number keys 1-N jump to marshal.
- `main.py`: `GET /marshal_overview` endpoint.
- `api_client.gd`: `get_marshal_overview()` method.
- `top_bar.gd`: Generals button enabled, wired to marshal management screen.
- `main.gd`: Marshal management scene loaded and registered with top bar.
- Ability active derivation hardcoded by name (Ney/Drouot/Wellington/Blucher/Uxbridge = active). TODO: Replace with proper `Marshal.ability_wired` field (Phase 7b or Pre-EA).

### Feb 21 (Session B: Strategic Ledger)

- Campaign log refactored to layer 50, notification bar reparented into top bar.
- Input refactor: `_is_modal_dialog_open()`, `_is_screen_open()`, `_is_hotkey_blocked()`.
- Hotkeys: L (Event Log), T (Ledger), G (Generals placeholder), D (Dispatch).

---

### Feb 21 (Notification System + Audit)

**EU4-style persistent notification bar. 9 triggers, 3 priority tiers. 70 tests total (51 + 19 audit).**

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| V1 global objection cap still active for strategic path | Low | `disobedience.py:25` MAX_MAJOR_OBJECTIONS_PER_TURN=2. Remove in V2b cleanup. |
| No mid-objection save/load roundtrip test | Low | Serialization enforcement confirms fields exist, but no test with populated V2 pending_objection. |
| Missing AI test coverage for P3, P4.75, P7 | Medium | P3 (threat response), P4.75 (ally support), P7 (strategic movement) have zero direct unit tests. |
| Residual 2-turn fortify oscillation possible | Low | `_unfortified_this_turn` only prevents same-turn re-fortify. Stagnation counter is backstop. |
| `requires_input` interrupt blocks later marshals | Low | `strategic.py:119` stops processing ALL further marshals when one requires input. |
| `full_game.py` dead code with stale terrain | Low | 3 `resolve_battle()` calls hardcode `terrain="open"`. File is dead code. |
| France hardcoded as player nation | Low | Multiple systems assume France. Post-EA multi-nation play requires threading player_nation. |
| `ability_active` hardcoded by marshal name | Low | `marshal_overview.py` derives ability_active from `_WIRED_ABILITY_MARSHALS` set. Replace with proper `Marshal.ability_wired` field. Pre-EA or Phase 7b. |
| `resolve_battle()` has 5 categories of side effects | High | Phase 7 `apply_casualties=False` must defer all 5. See `PHASE7_SPEC_AMENDMENTS.md` C1. |
| Cross-nation coordination impossible (Britain/Prussia) | Medium | Deferred to Phase 7b with Coalition Trigger. See `PHASE7_SPEC_AMENDMENTS.md` C3. |
| Missing SUPPORT objection triggers | Low | Add in Phase 7 Session 59. |
