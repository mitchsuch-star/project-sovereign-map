---

## Phase 6: Core Campaign Systems

**Goal:** Complete playable campaign loop with resources and win conditions.

| Feature | Description | Complexity | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Economy | Income per region, treasury, upkeep | Medium | 📋 |
| Reinforcements (Enemy) | AI can recruit troops | Low | 📋 |
| Manpower Pools | Separate: Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery | Medium | 📋 |
| Attrition | Movement/supply decay | Low | 📋 |
| Fog of War | Hidden enemies, scouting required | Medium | 📋 |
| Terrain | Region terrain affects combat/movement | Medium | 📋 |

| Artillery Unit Type | Combat buffs like cavalry | Medium | 📋 |
| **War Score** | Visual progress toward victory/defeat | Low | 📋 |
| **Threat Indicator** | Coalition threat level, visible buildup | Low | 📋 |

**Dependencies:** None  
**Exit Criteria:** Player manages economy, enemies reinforce, terrain matters, can see war progress

---

## Phase 6.5: Information & UI Systems

**Goal:** Player can track 200 regions, 30 marshals, 8 nations without drowning.

| Feature | Description | Complexity | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Notification System | Alerts for key events (invasions, deaths, diplomacy) | Medium | 📋 |
| Strategic Ledger | Overview screen: all marshals, armies, nations | Medium | 📋 |
| Marshal Management UI | View/manage all marshals, relationships, recruit | Medium | 📋 |
| Campaign Log | Scrollable history of major events | Low | 📋 |
| Tooltips | Hover info on regions, marshals, nations | Low | 📋 |

**Dependencies:** Phase 6 (needs data to display)  
**Exit Criteria:** Player has clear visibility into game state

---

## Phase 7: Multi-Marshal & Relationships

**Goal:** Multiple marshals fight together, relationships have gameplay impact.

| Feature | Description | Complexity | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Multi-marshal battles | Combined strength in single fight | High | 📋 |
| Command structure | Senior marshal leads combined force | Medium | 📋 |
| Coordination bonus/penalty | Relationships affect combined combat | Medium | 📋 |
| Strategic + Relationships | "Support Ney" → reaction based on feelings | Medium | 📋 |
| Jealousy system | Marshal getting all glory → others resent | Medium | 📋 |

### AI Enhancement: Combined Strength Evaluation ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**What:** AI evaluates attack decisions using combined strength of all friendly marshals in the same region, not just the individual marshal's strength.

**Why:** Prevents AI from being timid when it has overwhelming local superiority (e.g., two marshals trapped in dead-end should recognize they can fight their way out together).

**Note:** This affects DECISION-MAKING only. Actual coordinated attacks (combined damage) planned for Phase 7 multi-marshal commands.

### AI Enhancement: P0 Survival Instinct (Future)

**Current behavior:**
- AI only retreats via P0 when enemy is in same region AND ratio is below threshold
- A marshal at 10% strength might still counter-attack a full-strength enemy if personality is aggressive

**Proposed enhancement:**
- Add "critical survival" override to P0
- If marshal strength < 20% of starting_strength AND enemy in same region → ALWAYS retreat regardless of personality
- Rationale: Even Blucher wouldn't charge at 10% strength against a fresh army
- This is "survival instinct" not cowardice

**Implementation notes:**
- Add to P0 in enemy_ai.py, before personality threshold check
- Use starting_strength field (already tracked on marshal)
- Threshold could be personality-adjusted: Cautious 30%, Normal 20%, Aggressive 15%

**Status:** Planned for Phase 7

**Dependencies:** Phase 6.5 (Marshal Management UI)
**Exit Criteria:** Multi-marshal commands work, relationships affect outcomes

---
